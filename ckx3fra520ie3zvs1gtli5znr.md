## 🤝 Introduction

[7 awesome](https://blog.warengonzaga.com/series/7-awesome) is my latest tech blog series where I'm gonna share the top list of anything related to software engineering. Have a list in mind let me know in the comments below! 😉 Let's start!

Today I'm gonna share with you the top 7 awesome web animation libraries and frameworks you should know as a software developer. 🤯 These are the web animation that might help you in your current and future projects. Let's go straight to the content right away! 😅

## ✨ The 7 Awesome

Here are the top 7 awesome web animation libraries and frameworks. I ranked them based on my usage experience and how popular the project is. The decision I made is based on this [tool to compare them easily](https://www.githubcompare.com/animate-css/animate.css+juliangarnier/anime+julianshapiro/velocity+mrdoob/three.js+maxwellito/vivus+mojs/mojs+greensock/gsap).

### 📦 ThreeJS

%[https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js]

Obviously the top on the list! Can't deny it... 😅

This is one of the best web animation libraries out there and you can create crazy amazing web animation with it. I have one example below of what it can do... 🤯

### 📦 AnimateCSS

%[https://github.com/animate-css/animate.css]

Let's admit it, this is one of the most useful CSS animation libraries out there. 😅

I'm part of the core team and made some significant improvements to the web animation library. You are not a developer if you don't ever use animate.css before. 😂 Don't take it seriously, what I'm trying to say is that every developer knows about it. 😎

AnimateCSS has an active community and I'm still working on upcoming updates. It has clear and reliable documentation for you to start using on your web projects. 😎

### 📦 AnimeJS

%[https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime]

If you want to make your web animation to the next level then AnimeJS is for you! 🤘 I can say that this is an all-in-one solution for web animation as it says "It works with CSS properties, SVG, DOM attributes and JavaScript Objects." Have a try! 👌

### 📦 Velocity

%[https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity]

A fast and reliable web animation replacement for jQuery's animate. I can say it is easy to use since it has the same usage as jQuery's animate. 😉 Velocity has great documentation and has an active community and is being used by big companies. Check it out!

### 📦 MoJS

%[https://github.com/mojs/mojs]

MoJS stands for Motion Graphics for the Web powered by JavaScript. It has a complete list of advanced tools to create advanced web animation for your projects. It has an active community and has comprehensive documentation for you to start using  [MoJS](mojs.github.io). 😎

### 📦 Vivus

%[https://github.com/maxwellito/vivus]

Do want to animate web things like crazy? Then start using Vivus lol. 😅

This is so powerful when you want to play with SVG elements on your web projects. It blows my mind when I first discovered this simple and lightweight (with no dependencies) animation library. Check out the  [official homepage](http://maxwellito.github.io/vivus/)  for you to see it in action.

### 📦 GreensockJS or GSAP

%[https://github.com/greensock/GSAP]

The final in the list, the amazing GSAP! 👌😉

GSAP by [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) is the most amazing and reliable animation library and framework. They are the standard for modern web animation. I agree with that... 😁 When I start working on web animation this is the first library and framework I use to create advanced web animation for making HTML5 banner ads when I was a junior front-end developer. This is the advanced web animation tool in my time. 😃

I'm one of the active community members back then and I help others how to use the library and framework. Until today I know how to use GSAP for rapid web animation. 😉

I recommend checking out the [website](https://greensock.com/showcase/) for more information.

## 🐱‍👤 Last Words

I want to point out that it is not required to use libraries and frameworks when it comes to web animations. I learned the hard way back then when I start working as a junior developer. I animate the web without using any libraries and frameworks and it was like a hell. 😅

To lessen the tasks, I started using these libraries and frameworks to get the job done as fast as I can. In a corporate world, they don't care what you know and what you use as long as you complete your job in the right way. 😁 I know you know what I mean... 😅

My recommendation, learn the fundamentals and start learning them with libraries or frameworks because along the way you'll pick up it. Just explore! Learn by doing... 🥰
