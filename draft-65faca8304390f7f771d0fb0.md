Hello, everyone! I hope you're doing well guys... this time I'm gonna share what I know about Phishing attack vectors... someone ask me how they can replicate a login page with the exact copy in terms of look and feel and that's our topic for today.

Today, we are going to replicate the Github login page, and we will harvest the login information from both mobile and Linux machine setup. (Cool? Of course!)

## Social Fish

This tool is the answer to the problem, social fish can replicate almost any login page from popular websites for phishing purposes. It can record login information and redirect the user after hitting the submit button or similar. The redirection is configurable so you don't have to worry.

Note: Not all the login page can copy by this tool. There are some websites prevented this tool to copy their login page. One example is a bitcoin-related website.

## The Setup

It is easy to set up if you have enough knowledge of using Linux. I will try my best to show the setup steps as simple as I can. Let's start with your Kali Linux machine setup.

I will assume that you have your own hacking laboratory setup...

Go to your Kali Linux Desktop and type the following below.

> **root@kali:~#** cd ../opt/

Now, you're in the installation of add-on application software packages folder. This is we will install the Social Fish. Now type the following commands below to download and install the said social engineer tool.

first, let's update our source...

> **root@kali:/opt#** apt-get update

Once done, we will clone the official repository of the tool. Copy and paste the command below.

> **root@kali:/opt#** git clone [https://github.com/UndeadSec/SocialFish.git](https://github.com/UndeadSec/SocialFish.git)

After that, you should see a new directory inside the "opt" folder. To confirm it you can execute the command below.

> **root@kali:/opt#** ls -l

The command above will list the files on your current working directory. So you should see a folder named "SocialFish" and go to that folder using the command below.

> **root@kali:/opt#** cd SocialFish/

To confirm it that you're inside that folder just type "ls -l" and you'll see other files.

Now, let's install the requirements.txt before doing that we need to install the required software to install the requirements. SocialFish is written in Python so we will use the latest Python and PIP installer. Type the command below to install the required software.

> **root@kali:/opt/SocialFish#** apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev -y

The command is pretty straight forward, it will install the software if it is not available on our machine. This is a good way to install software if we are not sure if it is already on our machine or not.

Wait for the complete installation...

Once, done type the following command below.

> **root@kali:/opt/SocialFish#** python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

You'll see running text and loading animation on your terminal don't panic lol... that's normal just wait until it fully installs the requirements.

## The Usage

Now, we can start using the Social Fish for the first time let's run the server by typing the command below with your desired username and password.

Why do we need a username and password?

This is to protect your server from unauthorized access. Your Social Fish server is your most important asset when you are about to make a successful replica of the login page of your target website. This is the one will collect the information and hosting your replicated page.

> **root@kali:/opt/SocialFish#** python3 SocialFish.py username password

In my case, use my name hahaha...

then hit Enter!

![](https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/uploads/project_updates/2020/02/3a67a4ba9bbbb8af6a7eabc6bdf7ca79.png align="left")

You should see similar to the image above... now open your browser and head to "**http://0.0.0.0:5000/neptune**" and log in!

![](https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/uploads/project_updates/2020/02/5fb80ceead9b0d2ceab6f8cc11464bb0.png align="left")

This is the login page looks like... just log in!

Once you inside here's the dashboard, you can scroll down for more information but this time we're going to copy or replicate a login page first. The red box shows where we should input the link of the target website.

Clone - This is the field where we are going to input the target login page with the exact URL.

Redirection - This is the field where we are going to redirect the users after they hit the submit button on the page. I would suggest leaving it to the main domain of the target website.

Here's my example!

![](https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/uploads/project_updates/2020/02/90df5c43373f9c5c6150d441f3d8be4f.png align="left")

Make sure you are pointing the exact URL of the login page or else you'll fail on getting login credentials. Now to initiate the replication, just click the "Thunder" icon besides redirection field. You should good to go!

To see your replicated page... then go to "**http://0.0.0.0:5000/**" that's it!

Awesome? Do you learn something new? Hahaha... I just show you how easily replicate login pages in just a minute. Congratulations, you have now working Phishing login page! Let's try it out now... I tried it with a username "warengonzaga" and with a password of "angpogiko" and let's see...

It turns out it is working very well... as you can see... it collects the necessary information for you to understand if your attack is successful or not.

> {'commit': 'Sign in', 'utf8': 'âœ“', 'authenticity*token': 'NTZGS7ExUM4tUJZoQM1G1AmlAdgXO5kx5Jl303IvCisg/CnqMimsi+xpwcmM2SCClLYpCwrZC8AXy7zqhdRn/A==', 'ga*id': '1081414078.1582731137', 'login': 'warengonzaga', 'password': 'angpogiko', 'webauthn-support': 'unsupported', 'webauthn-iuvpaa-support': 'unsupported', 'return*to': '', 'required*field*f65d': '', 'timestamp': '1582731133703', 'timestamp*secret': '679c1996aaa6f47c39ab5682362385724145bac0499b80ef3d4ff10a709ca513'}

When you click the "view" button you'll get that data... just extract the "username" and "password" and you're done.

## The Mobile SocialFish

For you to be able to use this just install it from the Google Play app. It is free...

The reason why they created a mobile version is to make it easy to monitor the target whenever you're not in front of your hacking computer. So you can continue monitoring on the go...

You need to create a public URL to your localhost server so you can connect your mobile and also you can use it to send it to your target. "http://0.0.0.0:5000" is not a good way to send this to your target it will not work.

We will install and use **NGROK** so we can create a public URL in instant. Make sure you have an account with NGROK because it is required in the following steps.

[Download the NGROK and go here and follow the steps...](https://ngrok.com/download)

There is a completely straight forward step by step on the download page of NGROK. Follow the steps until you reach the 3rd step. For the 4th step, you need to use the following command below.

> **./ngrok http 5000**

Now, you should receive a custom URL for your localhost server.

That's it! That's your URL... you can use the HTTPS version or HTTP but I would suggest using the HTTPS version to make it more legit login page to your target.

Copy the URL from NGROK and use it on your mobile!

If you ask me where to get the token... then go back to your localhost server dashboard"http://0.0.0.0:5000/creds"

You'll see the QR code image on the left side just scan it or copy the token... that's it!

got it now? let's login on your mobile and you'll see the dashboard like below.

Cool? Now you can replicate any login page you want including Facebook lol... I will leave it to you where you want to use this but again, I don't promote hacking here. This is for educational purposes only and I want to share with you how to easily replicate a simple login page with the use of this tool.

## Goodbye

I hope you enjoy this technical security blog for the Phishing topic... if you find this useful and helpful please consider sending me some cups of coffee...

See you on my next tutorial... peace out!
