Recently, we steal [WiFi passwords stored in the Windows machine](https://github.com/WarenGonzaga/wifi-passview). This time, I'm gonna teach you how to steal all stored passwords on your target Windows machine. Basically, we are not going to steal any passwords from anyone because that's illegal, always ask for permission.

This is for educational purposes only, this is to show you how easily extract all the passwords in a vulnerable Windows machine...

## Let's Get Started!

We will use a popular kali Linux tool called [**Lazagne**](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) developed by [**AlessandroZ**](https://github.com/AlessandroZ)!

That's the only requirement... if you visit the Github repo everything is there and the usage is pretty straight forward. In this membership-only post, I'm gonna show you how to use it step by step.

## Let's Build a Hacking Tool!

Oh, let's do this... in this tutorial we will not use the standalone one because chrome will block it before you download it. We will clone the Github repo and create a standalone for us.

**Take Note**: Make sure you have [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2717/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed in your working machine. Also, don't forget to install the [Python PIP](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). [More tutorial here](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&-pip-Windows-installation)!

Open your command prompt and follow the instructions below...

* Create a folder called "Hacker" or any name you want this is for the tutorial purposes for you to understand.

* Clone the tool from its official Github repo...

* Go to the folder of Lazagne and check its contents... follow the command below.

* Now, let's install the requirements and setup the Lazagne tool.

* After the setup, we are going to compile the tool. Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/wiki/How-to-compile). Download the .whl file from PyWin32 website and install it by using pip.
    

> pip install pywinXX-XXX-aaXX-aaXXa-win-aaaaa.whl

* Next is installing the pyinstaller...
    

> pip install pyinstaller

* Now, your other problem is where to get the "msvcp100.dll and msvcr100.dll"? You can download these files here, [https://www.dll-files.com/](https://www.dll-files.com/) don't download the file if you think you have already these files. Check your "C:\\Windows\\System32\\" folder to make sure.
    
* I'm done doing this part and let's skip... here's how to compile the tool in Windows machine.

* Now go to the "dist" folder and let's check the .exe file if we successfully compile the tool.
    

![](https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/uploads/project_updates/2020/03/4ffd056950070391a2dede022e8ecaa3.png align="left")

* It looks like we successfully compile the tool... now let's use this for extracting passwords lol.
    

## Let's Hack!

I will not use this against my workstation computer... I'm gonna show you the basic command to use this... you can't use this .exe file alone by double-clicking it. You need a command prompt to use this.

Here's the basic command...

> lazagne.exe browsers

This command will get all the passwords saved in the browser of your target Windows machine!

As you can see there are no passwords saved because I don't store any password in my browsers hehe. This attack is more effective if the target machine is not protected by any antivirus. Today, this tool is now detected by various AV products so this attack might not effective.

For more information on the command, you can just visit the [official repo](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne).

## Disclaimer

This is for educational purposes only, it only shows how scary to save your passwords in your Windows machine without having a proper and updated antivirus program. Now, you know how unsafe to store your passwords in your Windows machine.

## Solution

Use a password manager! [Try LastPass](https://lastpass.com/)! That would solve your problem regarding passwords.

## Bypassing Antivirus Programs

Alright, while testing the tool my antivirus program blocked it. For this tutorial, I temporarily disabled it to show you how it works.

[Sample of undetected lazagne build](https://antiscan.me/scan/new/result?id=eqTaPhIGSR93)...

To bypass av products you need to edit some functions put comments inside before compiling the tool same step but this part is for advance users. I can't teach this one right now in this post.

Bypassing av programs is a separate topic and post... see you in my next cybersecurity post!
