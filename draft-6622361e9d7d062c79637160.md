Previously, we learned [how to deploy the thirdweb Engine in less than 3 minutes on the Railway](https://blog.warengonzaga.com/how-to-deploy-a-self-hosted-thirdweb-engine-on-railway-in-less-than-3-minutes) platform using the template we created for the community.

In this blog, you'll learn how to deploy it on your local machine so you can explore and experiment with the [thirdweb Engine](https://thirdweb.com/engine) for your next or current Web3 project.

## Steps

1. Open your terminal on your local machine and execute the command below. It will clone my scripts into a new folder called `engine`.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/warengonzaga/thirdweb-engine-deploy-locally engine
    ```
    
2. ![A screenshot of a command line interface where a user clones a GitHub repository named "thirdweb-engine-deploy-locally" into a local directory, lists files in a directory, and navigates between directories.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713534926781/faf1e53f-6866-424e-9a40-1fa90c194f86.png align="center")
    
    Navigate to the `engine` folder and open the file named `.env.example`. Fill out the required information. I prefer to use the nano text editor in this guide because it is straightforward.

    * `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS` - The wallet address that will configure Engine from the thirdweb dashboard. You will be able to add other admins later.
