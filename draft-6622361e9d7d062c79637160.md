Previously, we learned [how to deploy the thirdweb Engine in less than 3 minutes on the Railway](https://blog.warengonzaga.com/how-to-deploy-a-self-hosted-thirdweb-engine-on-railway-in-less-than-3-minutes) platform using the template we created for the community.

In this blog, you'll learn how to deploy it on your local machine so you can explore and experiment with the [thirdweb Engine](https://thirdweb.com/engine) for your next or current Web3 project.

## Requirements

## Steps

1. Open your terminal on your local machine and execute the command below. It will clone my scripts into a new folder called `engine`.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/warengonzaga/thirdweb-engine-deploy-locally engine
    ```

2. Navigate to the `engine` folder and open the file named `.env.example`. Fill out the required information. I prefer to use the Nano text editor in this guide because it is straightforward.

    | Variable | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS` | The wallet address that will configure Engine from the thirdweb dashboard. |
    | `THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY` | A thirdweb secret key was created on the [API Keys page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys). |
    | `ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` | Provide a string to encrypt sensitive data stored in DB. Do not change this value, or encrypted data will be inaccessible. |

    <div data-node-type="callout-text">To save your changes in the Nano text editor, press <code>CTRL+X</code>. It will then ask you to confirm the save. Simply, press <code>Y</code> and then hit <code>ENTER</code> to complete the process.</div>
    </div>
    
3. After that, start Docker on your local machine and ensure it is running.
    
4. ![Screenshot of Docker Desktop interface showing an empty state for running containers with informational tooltips about containers and how to run them.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713540842021/05db84e4-f35f-4cb3-b0a4-51d513dad942.png align="center")
    
    Now, return to your terminal and run `npm run start`, and it will handle everything for you. Watch your terminal pull the thirdweb engine docker image and set up your container. If you see the message below, your engine has been successfully deployed and is ready to use.
    
5. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713541903702/911d1a4f-b176-4518-b1e7-a5aa0f87701f.png align="center")
    
    Lastly, visit your endpoint URL at `http://localhost:3005` , and you should see something like the example below. That's it! âœ¨
    
6. ![A screenshot of a computer screen displaying a JSON response message that reads "Engine is set up successfully.

Okay, so you have the endpoint URL now, let's import your instance to thirdweb Engine dashboard. Follow the steps here.
