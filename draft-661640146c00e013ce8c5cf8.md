Are you looking for a production-grade HTTP server to interact with any smart contract on any EVM? That's the thirdweb Engine!

[Engine](https://thirdweb.com/engine/) is a backend HTTP server that reads, writes, and deploys contracts on a large scale. It allows you to create and interact with backend developer wallets, supporting high throughput with automatic nonce and gas management. Think of this as your rail transport vehicle or train **Engine** for your **Railway**. 🚂

[Railway](https://railway.app/) is a deployment platform created to simplify the software development lifecycle. It starts with instant deployments and easy scaling and includes CI/CD integrations and built-in observability. Let's say this is the **Railway** track for your train **Engine**. 🛤️

In this tutorial blog, you'll learn how to deploy your self-hosted thirdweb Engine on the Railway platform in less than 3 minutes using our [community-contributed Railway template](https://railway.app/template/fcEVay). This is the official community Railway template maintained by the thirdweb community team.

Without further ado, let's deploy your **Engine** to its **Railway**. 🚂🛤️ (you get it?)
