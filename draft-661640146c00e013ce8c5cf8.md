Are you looking for a production-grade HTTP server to interact with any smart contract on any EVM? That's the thirdweb Engine!

[Engine](https://thirdweb.com/engine/) is a backend HTTP server that reads, writes, and deploys contracts on a large scale. It allows you to create and interact with backend developer wallets, supporting high throughput with automatic nonce and gas management. Think of this as your rail transport vehicle or train **Engine** for your **Railway**. üöÇ

[Railway](https://railway.app/) is a deployment platform created to simplify the software development lifecycle. It starts with instant deployments and easy scaling and includes CI/CD integrations and built-in observability. Let's say this is the **Railway** track for your train **Engine**. üõ§Ô∏è

In this tutorial blog, you'll learn how to deploy your self-hosted thirdweb Engine on the Railway platform in less than 3 minutes using our [community-contributed Railway template](https://railway.app/template/fcEVay). This is the official community Railway template maintained by the thirdweb community team.

Without further ado, let's deploy your **Engine** to its **Railway**. üöÇüõ§Ô∏è (you get it?)

## Requirements

* [thirdweb API secret key](https://portal.thirdweb.com/account/api-keys#:~:text=Secret%20Key%2D%20Used%20to%20access%20the%20enabled%20thirdweb%20infrastructure%20services%20by%20identifying%20and%20authenticating%20your%20application%20from%20a%20backend.%20Sharing%20or%20exposing%20this%20key%20to%20others%20is%20unsafe%20because%20it%20grants%20access%20to%20all%20services.).
    
* [Wallet address](https://portal.thirdweb.com/glossary/wallet). (any EVM-compatible wallet address)
    

## Steps

1. Go to your Railway dashboard and create a "New Project."
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713272787740/636b8689-6594-47b4-848b-33ea57c25764.png align="center")
    
2. On the new project page, search for "thirdweb" or "thirdweb Engine," and you will find the template we created.

3. You will be redirected to the deploy page. First, click the "Configure" button for the Postgres service. Lastly, save the configuration and return to this page.

4. Let's set up the thirdweb Engine service. Enter your wallet address into the `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS` field, and then enter your "thirdweb API secret key" into the `THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY` key input field. After that, save the configuration and return to the template deployment page.

    All you have to do is click the "Deploy" button and wait.

    In less than 3 minutes, your thirdweb Engine will be ready for use. Go to your Engine service &gt; Settings &gt; Networking &gt; Public Networking to find your endpoint URL.
    
7. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713343606568/2d1e63a8-6cb4-4855-80cc-625624219585.png align="center")
    
    Open this endpoint URL in your browser, and you'll receive an API message response. This indicates a successful Engine installation. Be sure to save this; you will need it to import into your thirdweb Engine dashboard.
    
8. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713343998368/5d6acc5f-ae45-44c9-883c-e6128b0e3594.png align="center")
    
9. Now, let's import your endpoint URL to your thirdweb dashboard. Navigate to your [Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine) and select the "Import" button.

10. Name your self-hosted thirdweb Engine, enter the endpoint URL from your Railway project, and click the import button. Follow the example provided below.
    
11. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713344509842/2c6d53d1-e130-4abf-a59f-b30dfc347e41.png align="center")
    
    After you import it, it should look like this. Go ahead and view and manage your self-hosted thirdweb Engine from your account dashboard.

    Don't forget to create your **backend wallet** to execute write transactions and generate your **access token**. This will allow you to interact with your Engine API.
    
13. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713345091101/fdf637fc-060d-4da6-9b16-f9a9cccf47a3.png align="center")

    That's it! üöÄ
    

## Testing

In this section, let's test your engine to see if it works. The simplest method is to make a direct request using curl in your terminal. Just replace the `<xxxx>` with your Railway endpoint URL and provide your access token from your thirdweb Engine dashboard.

We will send a GET request to read the contract information for `name` on the `base-sepolia-testnet` chain. Let's use `0xD1042CC90244beeE8E30e1655f1935C3e8BFB86a` as our test contract address.

```plaintext
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://engine-production-<xxxx>.up.railway.app/contract/base-sepolia-testnet/0xD1042CC90244beeE8E30e1655f1935C3e8BFB86a/read?functionName=name' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your access token here>'
```

Copy and paste this command into your terminal and press enter. It should return a response with the name of our test contract. The name should be [Mata NFT](https://thirdweb.com/base-sepolia-testnet/0xD1042CC90244beeE8E30e1655f1935C3e8BFB86a).

You can also use the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) software to test your Engine. We performed a similar request using its graphical user interface (GUI). Enter your access token in the Bearer field as your authentication method, and then input your GET request URL. After that, click "Send." You should receive a 200 response code and the test contract's name.

This is it. If you see a similar result, you're good to go! üöÇüõ§Ô∏è
