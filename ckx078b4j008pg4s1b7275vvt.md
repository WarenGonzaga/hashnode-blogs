## Organize Your Starred GitHub Repositories Like a Pro

GitHub recently  [released a new feature called Lists](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-12-09-lists-are-now-available-as-a-public-beta/)  to the public as beta. 😎 I'm excited to share with you how you can organize your starred GitHub repositories like a pro. 🤘

## 🤝 Introduction

GitHub list is a feature for grouping your starred repositories into a list. 🤯 With the help of GitHub List we can organize your favorite repositories and share them with your followers or friends. Sounds useful? 😉 This feature is currently in public beta at the time of writing so you might want to  [share your feedback and suggestion](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/categories/lists-feedback)  to help improve it. 😃

## 🕹 Usage

I'm not going to teach you how to use the GitHub list since it is very easy to understand. Just navigate to your GitHub profile and click stars and you should see like this...

If not, then you might not have yet access to the public beta. 🤔 Let me know if you don't have access I might help you. 😅

Anyway, to create a new list all you have to do is to click the green button that says "create list" and click that. A pop-up will show for you to input the necessary details for your list. When you are done providing list details then save it.

Now you have created your own list then obviously it is empty. 😁

To add a starred repository to your list you only need to click the drop-down button besides stars in a repository, something like this...

I told you it is easy... 😂

## ✨ Organize Like a Pro

Here's the fun part! Did you see how I manage my lists? 😅 I'm gonna share with you how I manage my starred repositories so you can create your own maybe get an idea from my setup. 😉

As you notice my style has some emojis. 😂 It's up to you what style you prefer but here are the ideas and setup that can help you to organize your starred repositories.

### 💡 My List Idea and Setup

> 📌Interested - You Have My Attention 😎🤝

This is my list of public repositories I really like and am interested in. These are the repositories that might be extremely useful to you or anything that got your attention. 😁 Special shout out to my mentor  [Eddie Jaoude](https://github.com/eddiejaoude) for sharing the update and getting this idea from him, I'll share the video created by him at the end of this tech blog. ✌

> 💾Saved - My Saved Repositories 😎👌

This is the list for my saved repositories meaning repositories I found while searching or surfing the internet and need to check later. 😉

> 🛠Tools - Productivity Tools 😎👊

This is the list of tools I use for productivity. You might add your favorite open source tools too. The only limit is your imagination. 😎

---

The rest of the list setup might include your personal repositories and group them accordingly. For example, I published 6 NodeJS API clients and I grouped them into one list. Another example is a list of WordPress plugins I made and finally a list of OSS tools I made. It is extremely useful when you are working on multiple open source projects.
