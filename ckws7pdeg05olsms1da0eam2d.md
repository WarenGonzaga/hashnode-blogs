## The Perfect Domain Name for your JavaScript Library or Framework

Let's say you've published your first open-source JavaScript library or framework, now what? That's it? 🤔 Having an open-source project is like having a child. 👶 You need to take care of it and love your project. Let everyone know about your project, it might help them to make their life easier. 👌

Now, your open-source project should have at least a basic homepage then improve it from time to time as you have free time to work on it. Here's the question, what is the best domain name for a JavaScript library or framework? 🤔

## `js.org` Subdomain Name

Here's the answer to the question above, `js.org` for me is the best and perfect domain name for every open-source JavaScript library or framework. I made several open-source projects under this domain and it looks professional and making your project stand out among the rest.

My projects are under the `js.org` domain name.

- [buymeacoffee.js.org](https://buymeacoffee.js.org) - A simple and lightweight but powerful Node.js client for Buy Me a Coffee API.
- [gathertown.js.org](https://gathertown.js.org) - A simple and lightweight but powerful Node.js client for Gather Town API.

> More projects coming soon...

As you can see, you'll probably think that these are the official libraries for the services right? Well, the buymeacoffee.js.org is considered official recently and the gathertown.js.org is currently under consideration. Your project will stand out if you put effort into it. ✨

Popular projects under `js.org` domain name.

- [webpack.js.org](http://webpack.js.org) - A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
- [discord.js.org](http://discord.js.org) - A powerful Node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily.

### `js.org` is FREE

You'll probably think that having a `js.org` domain name requires any payment? 😅 

The answer is **NO!** You can enjoy your domain name for FREE forever. 🚀🥰💖 But, you might want to  [consider donating](https://opencollective.com/js-org)  to the organization? 🤔🙏

> I'm not affiliated with `js.org` I just love what they are doing to help others. Why not write a simple blog for them? 😁

## Get Your `js.org` Domain Name

I'm not going to teach you the step-by-step process because it is [already indicated here](https://github.com/js-org/js.org#step-1). What I'm gonna do is to share my experience of how I got my first `js.org` domain name (buymeacoffee.js.org) instead. 👌

The first thing you need to do is to think about what name you are going to use under `js.org`? Figure out this one first before applying to avoid duplicates. Try to visit the site if it is existing or not. If not, then you are good to go! 😎

Don't forget to read their [terms of service](https://js.org/terms.html) before applying for a subdomain name under `js.org`.

If you agree with the terms then read the [official documentation](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki).

Now, once you have the basic information about `js.org` then I'm gonna share with you how I got my `js.org` subdomain name.

### Name Your `js.org`

Think the best possible subdomain under `js.org`, that time I was thinking of `buymeacoffee.js.org` which is for me a professional domain name for an open-source project. It makes me happy when reading it or says it word by word. 🥰

> To clarify things, before I apply for the subdomain the project is already existed for about 1 year. I'm not saying that don't apply if your project is too young or new. What I'm saying is to apply for a subdomain if your project is for long-term purposes and you want to make it public.

### Fork `js.org` Repository

Make sure you have a GitHub account to get started. Let's assume you have an account and you know  [how to fork repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), now let's fork the [official repository](https://github.com/js-org/js.org) to your account. 🚀

In my case,  [I forked it into my account](https://github.com/warengonzaga/js.org). ✌

### Add Your `js.org` to the List

Now let's add your preferred `js.org` subdomain or my `buymeacoffee.js.org` subdomain to the official list. Open the file `cnames_active.js` and add yours!

I add `buymeacoffee.js.org` based on alphabetical order for example below.

```js
var cnames_active = {
  // more subdomains above...
  "butterfly": "cname.vercel-dns.com", // noCF
  "buttermilk": "buttermilk.netlify.com",
  "buymeacoffee": "warengonzaga.github.io/buymeacoffee.js", // here!
  "bwb": "shbwb.github.io/bwb",
  "bwb-docs": "shbwb.github.io/bwb-docs",
  // more subdomains below...
}
```

After the changes, prepare the PR! Don't PR immediately! Just ready for the PR! 👌

### Your Reason for `js.org`

The `js.org` is free for everyone, but consider applying if you have a valid reason. Honestly, before applying I published a  [discussion about the plan](https://github.com/warengonzaga/buymeacoffee.js/discussions/30)  of applying to `js.org` for the project [BuyMeaCoffeeJS](https://buymeacoffee.js.org). I guess following what I do is the best way to get your `js.org` subdomain. 👌😎

### Let's ask for Pull Request

Here's my [pull request](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/pull/6513) for the `buymeacoffee.js.org` you can follow the format I did and see the conversation with the maintainer. That time, I was using Vercel for the deployments but we are having some weird issues so I switched to GitHub pages instead. I didn't remove the Vercel since I am using a separate domain for a reason. I love to keep this domain name `buymeacoffeejs.warengonzaga.com` since this is the default and first homepage URL of the project. 😅

### Enjoy Your `js.org`

As you review my recent pull request it is successful with mild issues due to weird issues in Vercel. That's why this is my perfect example to share with you how I got my first js.org subdomain. 🎉

Your `js.org` subdomain should be available in no time. Please consider [donating](https://opencollective.com/js-org)  to the organization as they are helping thousands of open-source projects. 💖

Congrats on your first `js.org` subdomain! 🎉

## Pros and Cons of `js.org`

Almost everything has its pros and cons. Let's get straight to the pros and cons right away!

### `js.org` Pros

- It's FREE! Forever.
> Yes, free forever! You don't need to pay yearly for your domain name.
- Easy to Apply.
> As you can see, it is easy to apply if you have a valid reason!
- Active Community.
> So active that you can get a response within 24 hours. 
- Helpful Maintainers.
> The maintainers are so helpful and understanding, very responsive!

### `js.org` Cons

- No control to DNS settings.

> Honestly, you can't manage the `js.org` domain. They are providing subdomain access only. Every time you have changes to your subdomain you need to contact them.

- Public use only.

> If you are planning to use your project for commercial use then I would suggest buying a dedicated domain instead of using `js.org` subdomains.

- Vendor-specific hosting.

> In my case, I have an issue with Vercel while adding the subdomain. Don't worry you can still add Vercel hosted page, I'm just not lucky I guess lol. To make it work you need to host your page under GitHub or GitLab pages.

For me, that's all the pros and cons of using the `js.org` domain. Overall, I love what they do! 🥰

## `js.org`/`js.com` Domain Name

Wait, what? 🤔

Pay attention! We are talking recently is `your.js.org` which is a subdomain! This time, we are talking about a root domain name or `yourjs.org` / `yourjs.com`.

Let's get to the point, this is a perfect domain name for your JavaScript library or framework if you want to have complete control of your domain name if you are planning to make it commercial sooner or have personal reasons. I don't have any `yourjs.org`/`yourjs.com` domain names. 😁

Here are some of the popular JavaScript projects with their own `js.org`/`js.com` domain names.

- [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- [parceljs.org](https://parceljs.org) - Parcel combines a great out-of-the-box development experience with a scalable architecture that can take your project from just getting started to a massive production application.
- [gulpjs.com](https://gulpjs.com) - A toolkit to automate & enhance your workflow.

### Register Your `js.org`/`js.com`

Register your `js.org` or js.com domain name to a domain name registrar. I recommended registering your domain to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/).

> Please keep in mind that this is not free. You'll have to pay yearly for registering your domain. If you don't have funds or working on free software then I would recommend you to stick to the `js.org` subdomain name instead.

Next move?  [Point your domain name to your hosting](https://bfy.tw/S8Ki). 😅😂

## Conclusion

As you notice, the same pattern right? 😅 

Most of the JS libraries and frameworks should have a JS suffix to their name to indicate that they are libraries or frameworks. In my opinion, this is part of the tradition or culture. When we are working with JavaScript we intend to name it `script.js` and for making it short we call it `scriptjs` and eventually when we add styling to it we can say `ScriptJS` then if we want to register a dedicated domain name based on that name, we'll end up using `scriptjs.org` or `scriptjs.com` or `script.js.org` are you with me? 😎

For me, that's the reason why I call perfect domain name for your JavaScript library or framework.
